# Soft Mode in the Dynamics of Over-realizable On-line Learning for Soft Committee Machines
 **Frederieke Richert, Roman Worschech and Bernd Rosenow** <br/><br/>
Over-parametrized deep neural networks trained by stochastic gradient descent are successful in
performing many tasks of practical relevance. One aspect of over-parametrization is the possibility
that the student network has a larger expressivity than the data generating process. In the context of
a student-teacher scenario, this corresponds to the so-called over-realizable case, where the student
network has a larger number of hidden units than the teacher. For on-line learning of a twolayer
soft committee machine in the over-realizable case, we present evidence that the approach to
perfect learning occurs in a power-law fashion rather than exponentially as in the realizable case.
All student nodes learn and replicate one of the teacher nodes if teacher and student outputs are
suitably rescaled and if the numbers of student and teacher hidden units are commensurate.
